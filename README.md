### 🚀 Hi, I'm Giulia!

I'm a curious earthling who loves to solve problems and answer questions using data. Experienced in project coordination and communications management, I shifted my professional career towards data and I am now specializing in data engineering at Typeform.

I am currently improving my skills in:

- Python and Scala programming
- SQL database management
- Building data pipelines
- Data processing

and more... Yes, I'm a serial learner. There is always so much to discover! 🧠

Passionate about data for good, innovation, ethics and sustainability, I'm also a firm advocate of diversity and inclusion in STEM and support several networks and initiatives that work hard to make the tech industry a more welcoming place to be in.
