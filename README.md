Experienced in project coordination and communications management, I shifted my professional career towards data science. Some of my areas of interest are:

and much more. Yes, I'm a serial learner.

Passionate about AI for good, innovation, ethics and sustainability, I'm also a firm advocate of diversity and inclusion in STEM disciplines and support several women in tech networks and initiatives.
